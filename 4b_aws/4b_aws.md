# AWS Elastic Beanstalk Deployment Guide

## Step 1: Prepare Your Application
Before uploading to AWS, you must package your code.

1. Ensure your project folder contains `server.js`, `package.json`, and your `public/` folder.
2. Select all these files and Compress/Zip them into a single file (e.g., `archive.zip`).
   > **Note:** Do NOT include the `node_modules` folder in your zip; AWS will install dependencies automatically based on your `package.json`.

## Step 2: Create an Elastic Beanstalk Environment
1. Log in to your **AWS Management Console**.
2. Search for **Elastic Beanstalk** in the top search bar.
3. Click **Create Application**.
4. Configure Environment:
   * **Application Name:** `my-admin-dashboard`
   * **Platform:** Select **Node.js**.
   * **Platform Branch:** Keep the default (usually Node.js 20 or 22).
5. Application Code:
   * Select **Upload your code**.
   * Choose **Local file** and upload your `archive.zip`.

## Step 3: Configure Service Access
1. For **Service Role**, choose *"Create and use new service role."*
2. For **EC2 key pair**, you can leave it blank unless you want to SSH into the server later.
3. For **EC2 instance profile**, select a role that has WebTier permissions (usually `aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role`).

## Step 4: Review and Launch
1. Skip through the optional networking/database steps (Elastic Beanstalk will create a default VPC and Subnet for you automatically).
2. Click **Submit**.
3. Wait 3–5 minutes while AWS provisions your EC2 instance, Security Groups, and Load Balancer.

## Step 5: Access Your App
Once the environment health turns **Green (OK)**, you will see a Domain URL at the top (e.g., `my-app.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com`).

## Key AWS Concepts to Learn
* **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):** A private network in the cloud where your server lives. Beanstalk sets this up so your app is isolated and secure.
* **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):** The actual virtual server (the "computer") that runs your Node.js code.
* **S3 (Simple Storage Service):** Where your uploaded `.zip` file is stored.
* **Security Groups:** Virtual firewalls that allow web traffic (Port 80) to reach your application.

## Optional: Terminal Commands (AWS CLI / EB CLI)
If you prefer using the terminal instead of the website, you can use the EB CLI. Run these commands in your project folder:

**1. Initialize the AWS Beanstalk project**
```bash
eb init
```

**2. Create the environment and VPC**
```bash
eb create my-env
```

**3. Push updated code to the live server**
```bash
eb deploy
```

**4. Open the hosted URL in your browser**
```bash
eb open
```
